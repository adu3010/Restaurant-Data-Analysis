2. To perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
3. To analyze the data and extract meaningful insights.
4. To visualize the data and the insights obtained.

## Methodology
The project will involve the following steps:

1. **Data Acquisition**: The dataset will be obtained from a suitable source, such as a public repository or an API.
2. **Data Exploration**: The dataset will be explored to understand its structure, identify any missing or inconsistent data, and gain a general understanding of the data.
3. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: The dataset will be cleaned and preprocessed to ensure data quality and consistency. This may include handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types as necessary.
4. **Data Analysis**: Various analytical techniques will be applied to the dataset, such as descriptive statistics, correlations, and clustering, to extract meaningful insights.
5. **Data Visualization**: The insights obtained from the data analysis will be visualized using appropriate charts and graphs to effectively communicate the findings.
